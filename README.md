# ClassEcho: Student Feedback System

The ClassEcho: Student Feedback System is a Java console program designed to give students a voice 
in evaluating their instructors performance to ensure the student recieves quality education.
It allows user to input their feedback and ratings based on various aspect of teaching.

# OOP Concepts
The program uses classes and objects to organize the student feedback system. The Feedback class stores information about each feedback entry, 
like the student ID, rating, and comments, while the Methods class manages the programs functions, such as collecting and showing feedback. 
The Main class runs the program and lets users choose between the student or administrator portal. Each Feedback object holds one students response, 
and the program can handle many feedback entries at the same time.

***Encapsulation*** Encapsulation is used by keeping the data in the Feedback class private and only allowing access through public methods. 
This keeps the student information safe and prevents accidental changes.

***Abstraction*** is applied by hiding the details of how feedback is collected and stored. 
Students only need to choose a subject, give a rating, and write comments, while the program handles the rest. 
Administrators can see all feedback without worrying about how it is saved or calculated.
